Guide to geoJSON FeatureCollection with GCAM scenario data: 

Below is the schematic for the geoJSON FeatureCollection representing 32-region GCAM (excluding Taiwan). The schematic has three "general properties" keys: 
"type", "scenario", and "years". "type" is mandatory for the geoJSON format and specifies that it is a collection of features; "scenario" and "years" were generated by us. 
"scenario" is the name of the GCAM scenario we used, and "years" is a list of years used in the model output. 

"features" is a list of dictionaries. Each feature has a mandatory geoJSON "type" tag. The "geometry" tag encodes geometric data to draw the polygons corresponding with 
the feature. "properties" is a dictionary of attributes such as name and ID (more can be specified by the user). Finally, "primary_energy", in this example, holds output
from a GCAM scenario, in this case, primary energy data. Because primary energy is divided into multiple fuels, each feature's primary_energy key corresponds to a dictionary, where the keys are fuels and the values are lists of data where each entry corresponds with an entry in the "years" list. 

Please let us know if you prefer a different representation of the data and/or have suggestions on how to improve.
